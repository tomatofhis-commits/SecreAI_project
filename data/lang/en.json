Even the Emperor proposed, but she declined. On a night of the full moon in August, she revealed she was a resident of the Moon. Despite the brokenhearted old couple's efforts to keep her, celestial messengers arrived to take her back. She left behind an Elixir of Life, which the Emperor ordered to be burned atop the highest mountain in Suruga. That mountain became known as Mount Fuji, the mountain of immortality.",
